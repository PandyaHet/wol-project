				<p>Medulance was born with a simple plan:<br>
				To make ambulances available for a largely unaware Delhi.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="copy-container1">
					<p class="heading">The facts</p><br>
					<p class="contents">Delhi/ NCR is home to 22 million people plus tourists. WHO norms state that there should be 1 ambulance per 50,000 people: Delhi currently has 1 per 150,000, about 1/3rd the actual standard. According to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the unavailability of ambulances led to 28% emergency patients losing out on required treatment in 2012.
Medulance is here to change the ingrained perception of non-reliability on ambulances.</p><br>
					<p class="heading">Why Medulance?</p><br>
					<p class="contents">Have you ever needed assistance but not known how and where to look for ambulances? Have you had to go through the pain and loss of family and friends due to this unknown? We at Medulance, refused to let this problem be treated as an act of god anymore and decided to make finding an ambulance as easy as finding food or taxis these days.
Hence, Medulance was born, to assist lives. Using simple location based mapping, we seek to provide Delhi with quality ambulances, easier and faster than before.</p><br>
					<p class="heading">What are we doing?</p><br>
					<p class="contents">We are upgrading and digitalizing the traditional channels that were used to seek help. Our technology platforms were built to connect the customers and the ambulance drivers directly with each other in the time of need. We strive to provide high-quality, clean ambulances at competitive prices within minutes,
assisting the every day superheroes to reach the patients faster with the help of an easy and simple format. We believe that ambulances should be able to help you when it matters!</p><br>
